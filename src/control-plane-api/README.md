# Control Plane API

The Control Plane API is the central gateway for the CML Cloud Manager system. It provides:

- REST API endpoints for LabletDefinition, LabletInstance, and Worker management
- Bootstrap 5 SPA with Server-Side Events (SSE) for real-time updates
- Authentication via Keycloak (OAuth2/OIDC)
- Background jobs for worker monitoring and metrics collection
- CloudEvents publishing for external integration

## Architecture

This service follows Clean Architecture with the Neuroglia framework:

```
api/            # REST controllers, dependencies, auth services
application/    # Commands, queries, DTOs, background jobs, settings
domain/         # Entities, aggregates, repositories (interfaces)
infrastructure/ # Session stores, technical adapters
integration/    # MongoDB repositories, AWS EC2/CML API clients
observability/  # OpenTelemetry instrumentation
ui/             # Bootstrap 5 SPA source (Parcel bundler)
```
