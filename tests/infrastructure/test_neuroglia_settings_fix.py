"""Test to verify Neuroglia v0.6.8 properly registers Settings as singleton instance.

This test verifies that the bug documented in notes/NEUROGLIA_SETTINGS_LAMBDA_BUG.md
has been fixed in Neuroglia v0.6.8+.

The bug was that WebApplicationBuilder registered Settings using a lambda function,
which caused AttributeError when the DI container tried to inspect it.
