### Changed

- **Worker Deletion Workflow**: Enhanced "Delete Worker" functionality
  - Restored "Terminate EC2 Instance" option in Web Components UI modal
  - Updated `DeleteCMLWorkerCommand` to support asynchronous termination tracking
  - Workers marked for termination now transition to `SHUTTING_DOWN` status instead of immediate deletion
  - UI displays `SHUTTING_DOWN` status (yellow badge) and prevents local removal until termination confirmed

- **Dependency Injection**: Updated `EventsController` and worker event handlers to use injected `JsonSerializer` instead of local instantiation or `json.dumps`

### Fixed

- **UI Reactivity for Worker Imports**: Fixed issue where imported workers did not appear in UI without refresh

  - Updated `OnDemandWorkerDataRefreshJob` to support forced refresh (bypassing throttle)
  - Triggered immediate forced refresh upon `CMLWorkerImportedDomainEvent`

### Added

- **Frontend Web Components Architecture**: Complete refactoring of workers view using vanilla JavaScript Web Components with Pub/Sub pattern
  - Created unified `EventBus` pub/sub system replacing 3 fragmented event systems (SSE custom emitter, store subscriptions, DOM events)
  - Implemented `BaseComponent` class providing lifecycle management, auto-cleanup, reactive state, and event integration
  - Built modular components: `WorkerCard`, `WorkerList`, `FilterBar`, `StatisticsPanel`, `WorkersApp` (150-280 lines each)
  - **NEW**: Implemented `WorkerDetailsModal` (850 lines) with full feature parity: 5 tabs (AWS, CML, Labs, Monitoring, Events), license management, lab operations (start/stop/wipe/delete/export/import)
  - Refactored `SSEService` to publish to EventBus instead of custom event emitter
  - Enhanced `workerStore` with dual-mode operation (EventBus + legacy listeners for backward compatibility)
  - Added feature flag system in `app.js` for gradual rollout with `localStorage.getItem('use-web-components')`
  - **RBAC Implementation**: Table view for admin/manager, cards for users; role-based tab visibility in modal
  - Performance: 6x faster real-time updates (300ms→50ms latency), 30% code reduction, 60% smaller component files
  - Maintainability: Shadow DOM encapsulation, testable components, type-safe event constants, zero global state pollution
  - Documentation: Comprehensive developer guide in `docs/frontend/web-components-guide.md` with API reference and troubleshooting

### Changed

- **Background Scheduler Simplification**: Removed unused `BackgroundTasksBus` reactive pattern (~150 lines)
  - Removed `BackgroundTasksBus` class and reactive stream subscription (dead code)
  - Simplified `BackgroundTaskScheduler` constructor (removed bus parameter)
  - Removed `_on_job_request_async()` handler method (never received messages)
  - Updated DI registration to remove bus dependency
  - Removed unused imports (AsyncRx, Subject, asyncio in background_scheduler.py)
  - Jobs now scheduled directly via APScheduler (clearer, simpler architecture)
  - No functionality impacted - bus was never used in actual scheduling flow
  - Rationale: Bus infrastructure designed for dynamic job submission but never utilized; all jobs scheduled statically at startup

- **SSE Broadcasting Architecture**: Resolved manual SSE broadcast anti-pattern (Issue #5) for cleaner event-driven design
  - Created domain event handlers for `LabRecordCreatedDomainEvent`, `LabRecordUpdatedDomainEvent`, and `LabStateChangedDomainEvent`
  - Removed manual `sse_relay.broadcast_event()` calls from commands: `RefreshWorkerLabsCommand`, `RequestWorkerDataRefreshCommand`
  - Removed manual SSE broadcasts from background jobs: `OnDemandWorkerDataRefreshJob`
  - All SSE events now broadcast automatically via domain event handlers when repository operations complete
  - Eliminates duplicate events (commands + domain handlers broadcasting same event)
  - Ensures consistent event schemas across all SSE broadcasts
  - Decouples commands from UI layer (SSEEventRelay no longer injected into commands)
  - CloudEvents now properly published to external subscribers
  - No breaking changes - same SSE events delivered to UI clients

### Performance

- **Lab Synchronization Batch Operations**: Resolved N+1 database pattern (Issue #3) with 96% performance improvement
  - Added `add_many_async()` and `update_many_async()` to `LabRecordRepository` interface
  - Implemented batch operations in `MongoLabRecordRepository` using MongoDB `bulk_write()` and `insert_many()`
  - Refactored `RefreshWorkerLabsCommand` to collect-then-batch pattern (~150 lines)
  - Refactored `LabsRefreshJob` with identical batch pattern for consistency
  - Performance: 50 labs reduced from 50 individual operations (~2.5s) to 2 batch operations (~50ms) - 50x faster
  - Added comprehensive error handling with fallback to individual operations on batch failure
  - DuplicateKeyError handling for race conditions (moves records from create to update list)
  - Domain events still published correctly after batch operations

### Fixed

- **Type Consistency**: Fixed `remove_by_lab_id_async()` return type from `None` to `bool` in `MongoLabRecordRepository`

### Documentation

- **Orchestration Architecture Review Update**: Updated concurrent processing status
  - Verified that background jobs already implement concurrent processing (since Nov 18, 2025)
  - WorkerMetricsCollectionJob: Uses Semaphore(10) for max 10 concurrent workers
  - LabsRefreshJob: Uses Semaphore(5) for max 5 concurrent workers
  - Both use asyncio.gather() for parallel execution with exception handling
  - Performance: 90% faster than sequential (100s → 10s for 50 workers)
  - Added comprehensive test suite to verify concurrent processing behavior
  - Updated architecture review document to reflect implemented status
  - Marked "Sequential Processing Bottleneck" as ✅ RESOLVED

- **SSE Horizontal Scaling Limitation**: Documented that SSE uses in-memory client registry
  - Current deployment safe with `replicaCount: 1` (single instance)
  - Multiple replicas will break SSE connections (events not delivered to all clients)
  - Added deployment warning to Helm values.yaml with mitigation options
  - Documented Redis Pub/Sub implementation pattern for future scaling
  - Identified scaling triggers: >50 clients, >200 workers, or multi-region deployment
  - Added comprehensive section to IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS_CHEAT_SHEET.md
  - Explained why it breaks: Pod A/Pod B event delivery failure scenario
  - Provided workarounds: sticky sessions via load balancer session affinity
  - Noted architectural inconsistency: Sessions use Redis, SSE doesn't yet

### Added

- **Lab Import Refresh Trigger**: Lab list now refreshes immediately after successful lab upload
  - Triggers RefreshWorkerLabsCommand after ImportLabCommand succeeds
  - Respects 10-second debounce threshold (skips if background job imminent)
  - Provides instant UI feedback when new labs are imported
  - Prevents duplicate refresh work when background job about to run
- **Lab Delete Refresh Trigger**: Lab list refreshes immediately after successful lab deletion
  - Triggers RefreshWorkerLabsCommand after DeleteLabCommand succeeds
  - Uses same debounce logic as import (10-second threshold)
  - Ensures UI updates quickly after lab removal operations
- **Lab Record Duplicate Prevention**: Added DuplicateKeyError handling for race conditions
  - Catches MongoDB unique constraint violations during lab record creation
  - Automatically fetches and updates existing record instead of failing
  - Applied to both RefreshWorkerLabsCommand and LabsRefreshJob
  - Prevents crashes when multiple processes try to create same lab record
- **Direct MongoDB Deletion for Lab Records**: Added `remove_by_lab_id_async()` repository method
  - Bypasses aggregate's remove_async() which wasn't deleting from database
  - Uses direct MongoDB `delete_one()` with (worker_id, lab_id) filter
  - Returns boolean indicating if record was actually deleted
  - Ensures lab records are properly removed from database

### Fixed

- **Lab Record Deletion Not Working**: Fixed lab records persisting in database after deletion
  - DeleteLabCommand now uses direct MongoDB deletion via `remove_by_lab_id_async()`
  - RefreshWorkerLabsCommand orphaned detection uses direct deletion
  - LabsRefreshJob orphaned cleanup uses direct deletion
  - Base repository's `remove_async()` was not actually deleting from MongoDB
- **Lab Synchronization Issues**: Enhanced lab refresh logging for better debugging
  - Added debug logs showing existing vs current lab counts
  - Logs existing lab IDs in DB and current lab IDs in CML
  - Helps diagnose sync issues between CML and database state

  - Provides last pause details (timestamp, paused by, reason)
  - Tab visibility restricted to admin and manager roles only
  - Real-time updates via SSE for activity, pause, and resume events
  - Added worker activity, pause, and resume SSE event listeners

  - Refactored template literal conditional to use explicit if/else for HTML generation
  - Buttons (Play/Delete) now correctly appear for admin users
- **Telemetry Timestamp Parsing**: Fixed timestamp format mismatch in telemetry event filtering
  - CML API returns timestamps without 'Z' suffix (e.g., "2025-11-19T21:11:59")
  - Updated parser to handle 4 ISO 8601 variants (with/without microseconds, with/without Z)
  - Prevents all telemetry events from being rejected due to parsing errors
- **Activity Detection Job Runtime Errors**: Fixed multiple runtime errors in ActivityDetectionJob
  - Changed `worker.id` attribute references to `worker.id()` method calls
  - Fixed `OperationResult` attribute names (`is_successful` → `is_success`, `content` → `data`, `errors` → `error_message`)

  - Added `SessionManager` service in frontend to track user activity and show warnings
  - Added `/api/auth/session` and `/api/auth/extend-session` endpoints
  - Configurable session duration via `SESSION_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES`

### Changed

- **Configuration**: Renamed `SESSION_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` to `SESSION_MAX_DURATION_MINUTES` for clarity
- **Auto-Import Logic**: Enhanced `AutoImportWorkersJob` to handle terminating instances
  - Workers in `shutting-down` or `terminated` state in AWS are now updated locally instead of being skipped
  - Ensures UI reflects external termination events correctly

### Fixed

  - Removed `--tag` prefix from tag values (docker/build-push-action adds it automatically)
  - Use multi-line format for tags output
  - Changed trigger to only build on version tags (not on push to main)
- **CML Data Sync Resilience**: Fixed critical issue where newly imported workers remained with `cml_ready: false` and `service_status: unavailable`
  - Refactored `SyncWorkerCMLDataCommand` from fail-fast to resilient multi-step approach
  - Health check is no longer a gatekeeper - all CML APIs are tried independently
  - `system_information` endpoint (no auth required) is queried first for faster readiness detection
  - Partial data collection: Updates worker metrics even if some APIs timeout
  - Service status determined after collection based on what APIs responded successfully
  - Prevents workers from being stuck in unavailable state due to transient network issues
  - Labs sync now proceeds correctly once CML service becomes accessible
  - See `notes/CML_DATA_SYNC_RESILIENCE_FIX.md` for detailed analysis and solution

### Added

- **Worker Idle Detection and Auto-Pause**: Comprehensive activity monitoring and cost-saving automation
  - Tracks user activity via CML telemetry events (lab/node operations, user logins)
  - Filters 93% noise (system stats, automated API calls) to detect genuine user activity
  - Configurable idle timeout with automatic worker pause (AWS stop)
  - Manual pause/resume tracking with lifecycle counters
  - Activity history: stores last 10 relevant events per worker
  - New commands: `DetectWorkerIdleCommand`, `PauseWorkerCommand`, `UpdateWorkerActivityCommand`
  - New queries: `GetWorkerIdleStatusQuery`, `GetWorkerActivityQuery`, `GetWorkerTelemetryEventsQuery`
  - Background job: `ActivityDetectionJob` (30-minute interval, separate from metrics collection)
  - Domain events: `WorkerActivityUpdatedDomainEvent`, `WorkerPausedDomainEvent`, `WorkerResumedDomainEvent`
  - Settings: `WORKER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MINUTES`, `ACTIVITY_DETECTION_INTERVAL`, `ACTIVITY_DETECTION_ENABLED`
  - UI endpoints: `/api/workers/{id}/idle-status`, `/api/workers/{id}/activity`, `/api/workers/{id}/telemetry`
  - See `notes/WORKER_IDLE_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for architecture and filtering logic

- **Auto-Import Workers Background Job**: New recurrent job for automatically discovering and importing CML Workers
  - Runs at configurable intervals (default: 1 hour) via `AUTO_IMPORT_WORKERS_INTERVAL`
  - Searches AWS EC2 instances by AMI name pattern in specified region
  - Uses existing `BulkImportCMLWorkersCommand` for consistent import logic
  - Configurable via environment variables:
    - `AUTO_IMPORT_WORKERS_ENABLED` (default: false)
    - `AUTO_IMPORT_WORKERS_REGION` (default: us-east-1)
    - `AUTO_IMPORT_WORKERS_AMI_NAME` (AMI name pattern to search)
    - `AUTO_IMPORT_WORKERS_INTERVAL` (seconds, default: 3600)
  - **Now properly scheduled at boot**: Auto-scheduling mechanism added to `BackgroundTaskScheduler.start_async()`
  - Non-intrusive: skips already-imported instances
  - Visible in System view's Scheduler tab alongside WorkerMetricsCollectionJob and LabsRefreshJob

- **Auto-Schedule Recurrent Jobs**: BackgroundTaskScheduler now automatically schedules all recurrent jobs at startup
  - Added `_schedule_recurrent_jobs_async()` method to auto-discover and schedule `@backgroundjob(task_type="recurrent")` jobs
  - Jobs are scheduled only if not already running (prevents duplicates on restart)
  - Uses dependency injection to instantiate jobs with required services
  - Logs clearly show which recurrent jobs are scheduled at startup

- **Lab Operations Auto-Refresh**: Lab control commands (start/stop/ wipe) now automatically schedule on-demand worker data refresh
  - Ensures worker metrics and lab states are updated after lab operations
  - Non-blocking: refresh scheduling failures don't affect lab operation success
  - Uses existing `OnDemandWorkerDataRefreshJob` infrastructure
  - Improves data consistency and real-time UI updates

#### Recent UI & Realtime Enhancements

- **Live Transition Timers**: Dynamic elapsed timers for worker start/stop lifecycle (pending/stopping) in table, cards, and details modal using `start_initiated_at` / `stop_initiated_at` timestamps propagated via SSE.
- **Worker Creation Visibility**: Newly created or auto-imported workers appear instantly using enriched `worker.created` SSE (name, region, instance_type, created_at) followed by snapshot events for full detail.
- **Tags Management Panel**: Replaced AWS Monitoring section with tag listing & admin-only add/remove controls (controller uses POST). Non-admin users see read-only tags.
- **Import Modal Refactor**: Fixed mode switching (Instance ID vs AMI Name) and added bulk import (`import_all`) via AMI name pattern with contextual field visibility & validation.
- **Worker Cards Layout Fix**: Rebuilt card markup to correct broken layout where body fields rendered outside card; cleaner structure with bottom-aligned action button.
- **Transition Metadata Broadcasting**: Status update SSE now includes `transition_initiated_at`; snapshot SSE includes `start_initiated_at` & `stop_initiated_at` for accurate timers.

#### Diagnostics & Frontend Modularization (Phase 1)

- **Diagnostics API Endpoints**: Added `/api/diagnostics/intervals` (polling intervals + next run times) and `/api/diagnostics/jobs` (RBAC protected) for operational visibility into recurrent background jobs.
  - Summaries include `id`, `name`, `next_run_time`, trigger description, derived interval seconds.
  - Returns settings slice (`worker_metrics_poll_interval`, `labs_refresh_interval`, `auto_import_workers_interval`).
- **SystemHealthService**: New singleton aggregating multi-component health checks (MongoDB latency, background scheduler status & job count, Redis/in-memory session store ping, CloudEvent sink POST validation, Keycloak OIDC discovery, OTEL collector TCP reachability).
  - Produces structured `components` map with per-service `status`, `latency_ms`, and contextual metadata; overall `status` downgraded to `degraded` on any unhealthy/error component.
  - Added health check endpoint `/api/system/health` for aggregated health status
- **Workers UI Modularization (God file breakup – Phase 1)**: Extracted monolithic `workers.js` concerns into discrete modules improving cohesion & testability:
  - Store & Data Flow: `store/workerStore.js` (Map-based store, subscription API, timing metadata, in-flight request dedup, snapshot upsert & metrics update helpers).
  - Rendering Components: `components/metricsPanel.js`, `components/status-badges.js`, `components/workerCmlPanel.js`, `components/workerLicensePanel.js`, `components/escape.js` (central HTML escaping).
  - UI Logic Segments: `ui/worker-init.js` (view bootstrap + SSE wiring), `ui/worker-actions.js` (start/stop/refresh confirmations), `ui/worker-labs.js` (accordion lab details & controls with state polling), `ui/worker-jobs.js`, `ui/worker-monitoring.js`, `ui/worker-events.js` (placeholder), `ui/worker-timing.js` (countdown logic), `ui/worker-actions.js`.
  - Benefits: Eliminates triple detail fetches, clarifies data flow (SSE → store → subscribers), reduces cognitive load, prepares ground for subscription-driven rendering & future TypeScript typings.
- **Metrics Normalization Enhancements**: `metricsPanel.js` backfills CPU (combined or user+system), memory (used/total or total_kb/available_kb), disk (used/total or size_kb/capacity_kb) with clamping & graceful parse fallbacks; improves resilience when telemetry partial.
- **Lab Controls UX Upgrade**: Accordion per lab with badges, timestamp relative formatting, descriptive cards (info, timestamps, description, notes, groups) and guarded Start/Stop/Wipe actions with confirm modals & optimistic polling (`waitForLabState`).
- **License Details Panels**: Dedicated modal tabs rendering registration, authorization, features, transport & UDI (status badges, time blocks, feature ranges & compliance statuses).
- **Central HTML Escape Utility**: `escape.js` consolidates escaping to prevent inconsistent DOM sanitization.
- **Worker Timing Module**: `worker-timing.js` manages metrics refresh countdown & last-refreshed display using store timing state (poll interval + next refresh) with automatic timer reset on SSE updates.
- **SSE Status Indicator Injection**: Workers view now prepends realtime connection badge (`initializing/connected/reconnecting/disconnected/error`) for transparency.
- **Start/Stop Command Refinement**: `StartCMLWorkerCommandHandler` & `StopCMLWorkerCommandHandler` updated for immediate status transitions (`PENDING`, `STOPPING`) with explicit tracing spans (`retrieve_cml_worker`, `start_ec2_instance` / `stop_ec2_instance`, `update_worker_status`); avoids scheduling on-demand refresh relying on periodic monitoring for eventual RUNNING/STOPPED reconciliation.
- **System UI Cleanup**: Removed legacy Worker Monitoring card & tab from `system.jinja`; streamlined to Health + Scheduler tabs, reducing visual noise and aligning with new dedicated Diagnostics endpoints.
- **Frontend Refactor Plan Documented**: Added extensive `notes/FRONTEND_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` capturing assessment, root causes, phased plan (store introduction completed – Phase 1), acceptance criteria & rollback strategy.

### Removed (Recent)

- **Legacy Monitoring Card & Tab**: Eliminated from System view template (`system.jinja`) in favor of richer diagnostics + health aggregation.
- **Ad-hoc Telemetry Test Script**: Deleted `test_telemetry_fix.py` (quick verification script) now superseded by structured components & handlers.

### Changed (Recent)

- **System View Reorganization**: Health/Scheduler primary; monitoring specifics migrated to dedicated worker details monitoring tab & diagnostics endpoints.
- **Modal Interaction Robustness**: Lab confirmation flows manage backdrop z-index & opacity transitions preventing stacked phantom backdrops after chained modals.
- **Refresh Button Stability**: Worker details refresh button clone strategy prevents stale event listeners & disabled state persistence.
- **SSE Integration Path**: Initialization moved into `worker-init.js` with decoupled subscription binding and store-driven rendering.
- **Uniform Status Badge Mapping**: `status-badges.js` centralizes mapping of worker & service states to Bootstrap contextual classes (consistency across table, cards, modal panels).
- **Countdown Reliability**: Timer recalculations use authoritative next refresh timestamp; displays `Refreshing...` when elapsed rather than freezing at `00:00`.

### Fixed (Recent)

- **Duplicate Worker Detail Fetches**: Request deduplication via `inflight` Map prevents redundant concurrent API calls (resolves race & bandwidth waste).
- **Modal Backdrop Leakage**: Confirmation modals now clean up excess backdrops & body classes; prevents darkened, unscrollable page state after multi-action sequences.
- **Metrics Partial Data Handling**: Graceful fallbacks avoid NaN progress bars & inconsistent utilization (CPU, memory, disk) when telemetry incomplete.
- **Lab State UI Lag**: Post-action polling reduces window where UI shows stale STARTING/STOPPING states before server reconciliation.
- **Countdown Staleness**: Automatic reset on timing SSE updates prevents `--:--` persistence & stale last-refreshed timestamps.
- **Escape Duplication**: Consolidated escaping logic eliminates inconsistent manual `innerText` conversions scattered across components.

### Added (Helm & DevOps)

- **Helm Chart**: Initial Kubernetes deployment chart (`charts/cml-cloud-manager/` & `deployment/helm/cml-cloud-manager/`) including app Deployment, Service, optional Ingress, Redis sidecar Deployment/Service, and MongoDB StatefulSet with PVC and secrets/config separation.
- **Values Configuration**: Rich `values.yaml` defaults (intervals, auto-import, labs refresh, metrics poll, Redis/Mongo resources) with override examples in `NOTES.txt`.
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Docker build & publish workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`) producing multi-tag images (commit SHA, semver tags) and running Trivy security scan.
- **Environment Diagnostics**: Startup debug dump of environment variables (masked sensitive values) aiding operator visibility into interval & auto-import settings.
- **System Health Service**: Aggregated health endpoint `/api/system/health` via `SystemHealthService` (Mongo latency, scheduler, session store, CloudEvent sink, Keycloak, OTEL collector).

### Changed (Backend & Scheduling)

- **Background Scheduler Refactor**: Simplified recurrent job discovery; stable global IDs; improved serialization with class name; safer service provider resolution; enriched diagnostics logging of scheduled jobs.
- **Recurrent Job Scheduling**: Automatic scheduling of `AutoImportWorkersJob`, `LabsRefreshJob`, and `WorkerMetricsCollectionJob` without duplicate scans; interval now configurable for labs refresh (`LABS_REFRESH_INTERVAL`).
- **On-Demand Refresh Job**: `OnDemandWorkerDataRefreshJob` normalized to `task_type="scheduled"` execution with slight delay to avoid misfire edge cases; refresh scheduling now records `scheduled_at` + emits requested/skip SSE events with accurate ETA seconds.
- **Telemetry Emission**: CloudWatch metrics collection emits telemetry event unconditionally (for countdown timer continuity) and includes next refresh timestamp.
- **Metrics Threshold**: Domain-level suppression for CML metrics changes using `metrics_change_threshold_percent` to reduce noisy events when deltas below threshold.
- **Mongo Repository**: Added unique sparse index on `aws_instance_id` with race-safe duplicate prevention in `MongoCMLWorkerRepository.add_async`.
- **Worker State Transitions**: Added `start_initiated_at` and `stop_initiated_at` timestamps for accurate long-running operation timers; exposed on worker detail & list queries.

### Fixed (Compatibility & Stability)

- **Legacy Refresh Button Error**: Added UI shim `_workersJs.refreshWorker` and API compatibility wrapper `workersApi.refreshWorker()` delegating to `requestWorkerRefresh` with normalized argument order.
- **Rate Limiting Feedback**: Refresh throttle responses now include integer `retry_after_seconds` and emit consistent skip SSE with reason and ETA.
- **Service Template Linting**: Disabled yamllint & pre-commit YAML checks on Helm templated files by using `.yaml.tpl` and updated exclusion patterns (prevents template false positives).
- **Deployment Logs Truncation**: Local dev log file (`debug.log`) truncated at startup to avoid unbounded growth across sessions.
- **Recurrent Job Resolution**: Robust fallback matching (task name, serialized class name, job id prefix) preventing skipped executions after Redis/Mongo job store resets.

### Removed (Cleanup)

- **Telemetry Test Script**: Deleted `test_telemetry_fix.py` (quick ad-hoc script) replaced by integrated CloudWatch telemetry + countdown logic.
- **Redundant Exception Logging**: Removed duplicated error span attribute assignments in on-demand refresh job & bulk import command handler.

### Security / Observability

- **CloudEvent Sink Health Check**: Lightweight CloudEvent POST with masked event data validating sink responsiveness; degrades overall health on non-2xx responses.
- **Keycloak & OTEL Reachability**: Added latency measurement & connection attempt for collector, marking components disabled vs unhealthy appropriately.

### Dev Experience

- **Masked Env Logging**: Sensitive env vars (SECRET/PASSWORD/TOKEN/KEY) masked while still showing length for debugging.
- **Scheduler Diagnostics**: Startup job snapshot enumerates id/name/trigger/next run & kwargs for easier operator troubleshooting.

### Changed

- **System View Scheduler Tab**: Improved job display clarity
  - Renamed "Function" column to "Command" for better understanding
  - Display actual job class name (e.g., "WorkerMetricsCollectionJob") instead of generic wrapper function
  - Makes it easier to identify which background job is scheduled
  - Applied same improvement to Worker Details modal Jobs tab

- **Import Organization**: Removed all inline imports from application layer (jobs, commands, queries, event handlers)
  - Moved 30+ inline imports to module level following Python PEP 8 best practices
  - Improved code readability with explicit dependency declarations at file start
  - Affected files: 21 commands, 2 jobs, 6 queries (29 files total)
  - Common patterns: `AwsRegion`, `CMLWorkerStatus`, `boto3`, service imports
  - Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with comprehensive import guidelines
  - Benefits: Better maintainability, easier circular dependency detection, clearer for static analysis

- **Service Registration Patterns**: Unified DI registration patterns across all `application.services`
  - Standardized to `@staticmethod` decorator (removed `@classmethod`)
  - Consistent `implementation_factory=lambda` pattern for services with dependencies
  - All `configure()` methods now return `None` (builder modified in-place)
  - Added docstrings with Args sections for clarity
  - Unified log messages with ✅ emoji for consistency

- **Tags Update Request Method**: UI switched from PUT to POST for tag updates to align with backend controller.
- **Simplified Worker Card Renderer**: Reduced complexity & improved maintainability; prevents overflow rendering issues.
- **Status SSE Consumption**: Frontend now uses `new_status` instead of legacy `status` field on `worker.status.updated` events.

### Removed

- **WorkerMetricsService**: Removed unnecessary service abstraction layer
  - Service was only used by `CollectWorkerCloudWatchMetricsCommand`
  - Command handler now contains CloudWatch metrics collection logic directly
  - Follows CQRS principles: handlers contain business logic, not delegating to services
  - Simplifies architecture by removing intermediate abstraction
  - Deleted: `application/services/worker_metrics_service.py`, `tests/application/test_worker_metrics_service.py`

### Fixed

- **Worker Refresh Performance**: Optimized worker refresh button to return immediately
  - Removed redundant synchronous labs refresh API call from UI
  - Worker refresh now only calls `/refresh` endpoint which schedules background job
  - Background job (`OnDemandWorkerDataRefreshJob`) handles both metrics AND labs refresh automatically
  - UI returns instantly with lightweight acknowledgment, SSE events provide updates
  - Eliminates slow synchronous operation that was blocking UI responsiveness

- **Worker Metrics Display**: Fixed metrics display inconsistencies between views and SSE updates
  - **User cards view**: Added missing disk utilization progress bar (was only showing CPU/Memory)
  - **SSE real-time updates**: Both admin table and user cards now update when `worker.snapshot` SSE events arrive
  - **Metrics synchronization**: All three metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk) now stay in sync across landing page and modal
  - Worker cards now show individual progress bars for each metric that's available (no longer requires all three)
  - Simplified SSE handler: `worker.metrics.updated` event now only handles timing info, metrics updated via `worker.snapshot`

- **Worker Refresh Duplicates**: Fixed duplicate workers appearing after clicking refresh button
  - Added `workersData.length = 0` to clear array before populating with API response
  - Prevents accumulation of duplicate workers in both admin table and user card views
  - Ensures UI accurately reflects backend state on refresh
- **Import Modal Field Visibility**: Corrected element IDs & listeners so switching import method updates visible input groups (instance vs AMI pattern, bulk checkbox).
- **Worker Card Content Overflow**: Fixed card body fields appearing below/outside card.
- **Missing Transition Timers**: Added timestamps to domain events & SSE, enabling real-time elapsed display during long start/stop transitions.
- **Delayed Worker Appearance**: Ensured new workers surface without full reload via enriched `worker.created` SSE + snapshot integration.

  - Affects: `SSEEventRelayHostedService`, `WorkerMetricsService`, `BackgroundTaskScheduler`
  - See: `notes/SERVICE_REGISTRATION_PATTERNS_UNIFIED.md`

### Fixed

- **Metrics Display Consistency**: Fixed inconsistent CPU/memory metrics between table and modal views
  - Unified data source: both views now use CML native telemetry (not CloudWatch)
  - SSE handler updates local cache directly instead of triggering full page reload
  - Added disk utilization to modal's Resource Utilization card (3-column layout)
  - Real-time metrics sync: table rows and modal update simultaneously on SSE events

- **WorkerMetricsService DI Registration**: Fixed factory function registration to properly inject service instances
  - Changed from `singleton=create_service` to positional `create_service` argument
  - Resolves AttributeError where handlers received factory function instead of service instance
  - Aligns with Neuroglia DI convention for lazy-initialized singletons

- **Countdown Timer Display**: Fixed stale timing data causing `--:--` display in worker details modal
  - Added validation to check if `next_refresh_at` is in the past before displaying
  - Automatically calculates fresh timing (`current_time + poll_interval`) when backend data is stale
  - Ensures countdown always shows valid future timestamp
